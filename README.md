# Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis (HLTA)
HLTA is a novel method for hierarchical topic detection. Specifically, it models document collections using a class of graphical models called *hierarchical latent tree models (HLTMs)*. The variables at the bottom level of an HLTM are observed binary variables that represent the presence/absence of words in a document. The variables at other levels are binary latent variables, with those at the lowest latent level representing word co-occurrence patterns and those at higher levels representing co-occurrence of patterns at the level below. Each latent variable gives a soft partition of the documents, and document clusters in the partitions are interpreted as topics. Unlike LDA-based topic models,  HLTMs do not refer to a document generation process and use word variables instead of token variables. They use a tree structure to model the relationships between topics and words, which is conducive to the discovery of meaningful topics and topic hierarchies.

A basic version of HLTA is proposed here:

An accelarated version of HLTA is proposed by using Progressive EM:

# Quick Example

- Download the `HLTA.jar` and `HLTA-deps.jar` from the [Release page](https://github.com/kmpoon/hlta/releases).

- An all-in-one command for hierarchical topic detection. It brings you through data conversion, model building, topic extraction and topic assignment.
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.HTD ./quickstart someName
   ``` 

  If you are in windows, remember to use semicolon instead
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.HTD ./quickstart someName
   ``` 
   The output files include:
  * `someName.sparse.txt`: the converted data, generated if data conversion is necessary
  * `someName.bif`: HLTA model file
  * `someName.html`: HTML visualization 
  * `someName.nodes.js`: a topic tree
  * `someName.topics.js`: a document catalog grouped by topics
  * `lib`: Javascript and CSS files required by the main HTML file
  * `fonts`: fonts used by some CSS files
   
- You can also do
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.HTD documents.txt someName
   ``` 
   
  Your `documents.txt`:
   ```
   One line is one single document. You can have many sentences as you want.

   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit
   Maecenas in ligula at odio convallis consectetur eu ut erat
   ```
   
 - You may also run through the following subroutines to do  data conversion, model building, topic extraction and topic assignment step by step.
 - You may find the sample output files of the following four subrountines based on the quickstart example in the [samples folder](https://github.com/kmpoon/hlta/tree/master/samples).

# Subroutine 1: Convert Text Files to Data
 
- Convert text files to bag-of-words representation with 1000 words and 1 concatenation:
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.text.Convert myData ./source 1000 1
   ```
  After conversion, you can find:
  - `myData.sparse.txt`: data in tuple format, i.e. lines of (docId, word) pair
  - `myData.dict.csv`: the vocabulary list ('.dict-0.csv' is the list w/o concatenation, '.dict-1.csv' is after 1 concatenation, etc.)
  
  You may put your files anywhere in ./source. It accepts txt and pdf.
   ```
   ./source/IAmPDF.pdf
   ./source/OneDocument.txt
   ./source/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/HiddenSecret.txt
   ```
- Split into training set and testing set if needed: (v2.1+)
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.text.Convert --testset-ratio 0.2 myData ./source 1000 1
   ```

# Subroutine 2: Model Building

- Build model through with maximum 50 em steps (uses StepwiseEM)
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.HLTA myData.sparse.txt 50 myModel
   ```
The output files include:
  * `myModel.bif`: HLTA model file

# Subroutine 3: Extract Topic Trees

- Exract topic from topic model
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.ExtractTopicTree myTopicTree myModel.bif myData.sparse.txt
   ```

  The output files include:
  * `myTopicTree.html`: a website
  * `myTopicTree.nodes.js`: a topic tree stored in javascript
  * `myTopicTree.nodes.json`: a topic tree stored as json
  * `lib`: Javascript and CSS files required by the main HTML file
  * `fonts`: fonts used by some CSS files

- You may use the "broadly defined topics" to speed up the process. Under this definition, more document will be categorized into a topic. (ref [*paper*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06650) section 8.2.1)
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.ExtractTopicTree --broad myTopicTree myModel.bif
   ```

# Subroutine 4: Doc2Vec Assignment

- Find out which documents belongs to that topic (i.e. inference)
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.Doc2VecAssignment myModel.bif myData.sparse.txt myAssignment
   ```
  The output files include:
  * `myAssignment.topics.json`: a document catalog grouped by topic
  * `myAssignment.topics.js`: a document catalog stored as javascript variable
  * `myAssignment.arff`: doc2vec assignments in arff format

- You may use the "broadly defined topics" to speed up the process. Under this definition, more document will be categorized into a topic. (ref [*paper*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06650) section 8.2.1)
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.Doc2VecAssignment --broad myModel.bif myData.sparse.txt topics
   ```

# Evaluate Topic Model

- Evaluate by topic coherence
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.TopicCoherence myTopicTree.nodes.json myData.sparse.txt
   ```

- Evaluate by topic compactness. (v2.3+)
   ```
   java -Xmx4G -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.TopicCompactness myTopicTree.nodes.json GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin
   ```
   Download pre-trained word2vec model from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing

- Compute topic compactness in Python
   Install gensim (https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) before using the python codes for computing compactness scores in AAAI17 paper (http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2017/PreliminaryPapers/12-Chen-Z-14201.pdf). One pre-trained Word2Vec model by Google is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing. The description of the model can be found at https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/ under the section "Pre-trained word and phrase vectors".
   
 - Evaluate by loglikelihood. You will need to create a testing set in advance. (v2.1+)
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.PerDocumentLoglikelihood myModel.bif myData.test.sparse.txt
   ```

# Options
As introduced in Subroutine2 of Quick Example, we can train HLTA with default hyper-parameters by :
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar tm.hlta.HLTA myData.sparse.txt 50 myModel
   ```
   
HLTA also supports to tune hyper-parameters by (v2.3+):
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar clustering.StepwiseEMHLTA $trainingdata $EmMaxSteps $EmNumRestarts $EM-threshold $UDtest-threshold $outputmodel $MaxIsland $MaxTop $GlobalsizeBatch $GlobalMaxEpochs $GlobalEMmaxsteps $IslandNotBridging $SampleSizeForstructureLearn $MaxCoreNumber $parallelIslandFindingLevel $CT-threshold
   ```

For example (v2.3+),
   ```
   java -cp HLTA.jar:HLTA-deps.jar clustering.StepwiseEMHLTA myData.sparse.txt 50 3 0.01 3 myModel 15 30 500 10 100 1 10000 2 1
   ```

Notice that, to speed up the training:
1. $trainingdata: the file name of training data
2. $EmMaxSteps: max steps in EM (default: 50)
3. $EmNumRestarts: numner of restarters in EM (default: 3)
4. $EM-threshold: threshold to control the stop of EM (default: 0.01)
5. $UDtest-threshold: threshold to control whether the islands can pass UDtest (default: 3)
6. $outputmodel: name of output model
7. $MaxIsland: The maximum number of variables in one island (default: 15)
8. $MaxTop: max variable numbers for top level (default: 30)
9. $GlobalsizeBatch: batch size in global stepwise EM for parameter learning (default: 500)
10. $GlobalMaxEpochs: max epoch number in global stepwise EM for parameter learning (default: 10)
11. $GlobalEMmaxsteps: step numbers  in global stepwise EM for parameter learning (default: 100)
12. $IslandNotBridging: remove island bridging or not, the default value is 1 meaning to remove island bridging. (default: 1)
13. $SampleSizeForstructureLearn: how many samples are used in structure leanring. (default: 10000)
14. $MaxCoreNumber: means the number of parallel CPU process. (default: 2) Users can choose a suitable core number considering the scale of their dataset. The further analysis on the balance of speed and performance can be found [*paper*](https://github.com/kmpoon/hlta/wiki/Document-for-Speeding-up-HLTA). Notice that, this number should not exceed the CPU core number of your machine, otherwise, it will slow HLTA.
15. $parallelIslandFindingLevel: when $MaxCoreNumber > 1, $parallelIslandFindingLevel means the max level that use parallel island finding. For example, $parallelIslandFindingLevel == 3 means level1, level2 and level3 use parallel island finding; while other levels use serial island finding.
16. $CT-threshold: threshold to control whether the island can pass correlation test, leave this empty to skip correlation test (default: empty, that is no correlation test)

# Assemble
